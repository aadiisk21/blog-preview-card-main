# Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card

This is my solution to the **Blog Preview Card** challenge on Frontend Mentor.  
The goal of this project was to build a clean, responsive blog card component using HTML and CSS.

Frontend Mentor challenges help improve frontend skills by working on realistic UI projects.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design (Media Queries)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Creating responsive layouts using `flexbox`
- Managing spacing and alignment for different screen sizes
- Using CSS variables for consistent theming
- Implementing hover states for better user interaction

This project also helped me practice structuring a clean UI component with minimal and maintainable CSS.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Advanced responsive techniques using `clamp()` and fluid typography
- Accessibility best practices (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Adding small JavaScript enhancements for better user experience
